# Overview

This program is a simple painting application made in Java. I am an artist and a programmer, and something I would like to eventually make is a great free mobile art app that is not stuffed with adds or locks basic features behind a subscription. This project is a first step into learning how to make are-related software. 

### Features
- Scroll to zoom in and out
- Hold Shift to drag canvas around
- Brush size slider
- Color picker
- Eraser
- Saving and importing PNGs

# Future Work

- Add layer functionality
- Fix a bug involving the 'save' button on color picker
- Make the eraser an actual eraser instead of a white brush
- Continue to add the basic features that any decent art app would have, like different shapes, selection tool, eyedrop tool, bucket tool, clipping masks, etc.
